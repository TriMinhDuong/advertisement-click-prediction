# Who do you want to show your marketing ad to maximum your profits?

## 1. Define Problem:

Our current problem is to predict who will most likely click on the ad and guide the marketing team to target the appropriate target customers to maximize profitability. Let's consider that I am working for a marketing agency and we utilize data analysis and machine learning to execute more effective marketing campaign.

Firstly, we need to understand how profit and loss is manipulated for digital marketing advertisement. Let's assume that our marketing campaign spend __1000CAD per potential customer__. For each customer that we target with our ad campaign and that clicks on the ad, we will gain __profit of 100CAD__. If we target a customer that do not click on the ad, __a loss of 1050CAD__ will be counted. There will be a situation that the customer that we do not target for the campaign clicks on the ad. For this case, we will gain the __profit of 1100CAD__. This situation will not likely happen for start-up business as we are on the initial stage of building brand awareness.
